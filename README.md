## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
  Detailed Explanation of the Proposed Solution

We propose a Smart Crop Advisory System (SCAS): a multilingual, AI-driven mobile and web platform designed specifically for small and marginal farmers. It leverages soil, weather, crop history, and image-based pest detection to provide actionable, personalized guidance. The system is designed to work even in low-connectivity areas and includes voice support for low-literacy farmers.

Key Features:

AI-Based Crop Advisory: Suggests optimal crops based on soil type, season, and historical yields.

Fertilizer and Soil Health Recommendations: Uses AI and soil sensor data to suggest nutrient requirements and fertilizer schedules.

Weather Forecasting & Alerts: Provides predictive weather alerts to help with irrigation, sowing, and harvesting.

Pest/Disease Detection: Farmers can upload crop images; AI detects pests/diseases and recommends eco-friendly treatments.

Market Price Tracking: Provides current and forecasted crop market prices to help farmers plan sales.

Voice and Multilingual Support: Supports major regional languages and voice instructions for digitally illiterate farmers.

Feedback Loop: Collects farmer feedback and system usage data for continuous improvement.

How it Addresses the Problem

Reduces dependency on traditional guesswork or unreliable local advice.

Minimizes overuse of chemicals, improving soil and environmental health.

Increases yield and income by providing timely, precise guidance.

Improves adoption of sustainable and modern farming practices.

Bridges language and literacy barriers.

Innovation and Uniqueness

Image-based pest detection combined with AI.

Localized, real-time advice tailored to microclimates.

Offline-first capability for rural connectivity limitations.

Voice-enabled interaction in multiple regional languages.

Continuous improvement through feedback and predictive analytics.

## Technical Approach
 Technologies to be used

Frontend: React Native / Flutter for cross-platform mobile app.

Backend: Python (Django/Flask) with REST APIs.

AI/ML: TensorFlow / PyTorch for pest detection and crop prediction.

Databases: PostgreSQL / Firebase for real-time data storage.

Cloud Services: AWS / GCP for scalability.

IoT Integration: Soil and weather sensors for live data.

Methodology & Process

Data Collection: Soil, weather, and crop history.

AI Processing: Predictive analysis for crop suitability, fertilizer, and pest control.

User Interface: Mobile app with voice and language support.

Advisory Delivery: Alerts, recommendations, and market insights.

Feedback Loop: Continuous learning from farmer usage and feedback. 


## Feasibility and Viability
  Feasibility: Uses existing mobile technology and cloud infrastructure; AI models can be pre-trained and continuously improved.

Challenges: Low digital literacy, internet connectivity, adoption resistance.

Mitigation Strategies: Voice guidance, offline mode, farmer training workshops, NGO collaborations.


## Impact and Benefits
  Social: Empowers farmers with knowledge; improves food security.

Economic: Increases crop yield and market efficiency, reducing costs.

Environmental: Promotes sustainable farming; reduces chemical overuse.
