## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
 Our solution is a Smart Crop Advisory System powered by AI, IoT, and cloud technology.

How it addresses the problem

Provides personalized advice based on soil type, weather, and crop history.

Bridges language barriers with regional language and voice support.

Reduces dependency on unreliable local advice through trusted data sources.

Enables real-time decision-making for farmers with instant mobile alerts.

Innovation and uniqueness

Multilingual, voice-enabled advisory for inclusivity.

Integration of image-based pest detection using AI.

Hybrid data model combining government research, satellite data, and farmer inputs.

Offline functionality for areas with poor internet access.


## Technical Approach
 Technologies to be used

Frontend: React Native / Flutter for cross-platform mobile app.

Backend: Python (Django/Flask) with REST APIs.

AI/ML: TensorFlow / PyTorch for pest detection and crop prediction.

Databases: PostgreSQL / Firebase for real-time data storage.

Cloud Services: AWS / GCP for scalability.

IoT Integration: Soil and weather sensors for live data.

Methodology & Process

Data Collection: Soil, weather, and crop history.

AI Processing: Predictive analysis for crop suitability, fertilizer, and pest control.

User Interface: Mobile app with voice and language support.

Advisory Delivery: Alerts, recommendations, and market insights.

Feedback Loop: Continuous learning from farmer usage and feedback. 


## Feasibility and Viability
 Feasibility

Technical: AI and IoT-based solutions are already proven in pilot projects.

Economic: Affordable mobile-first solution with potential government/NGO support.

Social: Easy adoption due to regional language and voice support.

Challenges & Risks
